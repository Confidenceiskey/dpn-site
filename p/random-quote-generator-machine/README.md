### [Random Quote Generator Machine Project](https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/build-a-random-quote-machine)

_This project is part of the [freeCodeCamp curriculum](https://www.freecodecamp.org), which helps you to learn how to code through online courses, projects and also provides interview preparation._

#### Project Guidelines
The aim for this project was to build a random quote generating machine. FreeCodeCamp allowed us to use whichever libraries or APIs that we required to solve this challenge. The design and UI was up to us to create.  
To complete the project, the below **user stories** needed to be fulfilled:
- I can see a random quote, along with the quote author
- I can click on a button to obtain a new random quote  
- I can press on a button to tweet out the existing quote

#### Project Approach

I decided to use an API for this challenge to obtain the random quotes, so I could further practice this skill. Initally I had used an API that now no longer works, so I've updated my code to a new quote api. 

I first started by designing the UI and got it to work with HTML and CSS. Once I completed that, I started adding functionality (one-by-one) with JavaScript and JQuery. I worked on connecting to the API, to get the quote and author to display on the screen. Next I would add the buttons to _tweet a quote_ and to _generate a new quote_. Finally I added the initial screen overlay button, and verified that everything works properly, including on various screen sizes.
